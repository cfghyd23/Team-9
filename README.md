Thalassemia is an inherited blood disorder characterized by less oxygen-carrying protein (haemoglobin) and fewer red blood cells in the body than normal. Around 4% of the Indian population are Thalassemia major gene carriers. There are currently around 1,00,000 Thalassemia patients in the country who require regular blood transfusions, amounting up to: 500-700 transfusions in a lifetime. 

Blood warriors embodies the core values of empathy over sympathy, circle of safety and collaboration and aims to make an India with zero patients by 2035. They run several programs to raise awareness about the disorder like on-ground campaigns, HPLC testing sessions which are tests to detect the Thalassemia gene and digital campaigns. They also organize blood donation camps in order to treat patients requiring regular blood transfusions. 


Challenges of a Fragmented Ecosystem
● Lack of awareness
● Low blood donation rates
● Blood banks are not well-equipped
● There is a lack of coordination between stakeholders
● Lack of transparency in sharing data
